## Usage: 
   When the script is active it will split every time that a level ends.
   AutoSplit will also start the timer by itself when the timer appears, IF NOT ALREADY RUNNING, you can use your own delay!
   Note that the end time will not be accurate to the frame and have to be retimed if the run was fast enough!

## Features:
   - Any% Support
   - Warpless Support.
   - Minus World Ending Support!

## Contact:
   The entire auto splitter is made by a guy who almost knows what he's doing so if there's a bug or a feature request don't be scared to message me on discord.
