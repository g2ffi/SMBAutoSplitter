   When the script is active, the autosplitter will start automatically when you start the game, and it will split and the end of every stage.  
   Note that the end time will not be 100% accurate to the frame, so a recount will be needed if your run is fast enough.

   - Warpless Support.
   - Minus World Ending Support!
